### Step-by-step guide to check whether risk allele for lactose intolerance can be found in your genome
Info: Lactose Intolerance is influenced by a genetic marker near the LCT gene.
Alleles:
GG - likely to be lactose intolerant
CG/CC - likely to not be lactose intolerant
Note: Make sure to have your sequenced/genotyped genome saved in a folder onto your computer. 

**Step 1:** Download R and RStudio
- R: [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
- RStudio: [https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/windows/RStudio-1.2.1335.exe](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/windows/RStudio-1.2.1335.exe)

**Step 2:** Open RStudio and open a project.
- Go to "File" and then click on "Open Project..."
- Select the folder containing your DNA and click "Open" in botton right corner. 
Now you should be able to see the files your folder contains in the buttom-right window of your screen:
