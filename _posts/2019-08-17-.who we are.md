## 

Story starts in 2001. in a small village in Istra in Croatia, founded by a group of enthusiastic science educators, the Summer School of Science expanded to Po≈æega in 2010 due to a large interest. It has an entirely international character and so far has hosted more than 300 students from Croatia, Germany, France, Spain, Turkey, Lithuania, USA, Sri Lanka, and many other countries. The Summer School of Science is an educational scientific program targeted at highly motivated high school students. The main goal of the School is to give students an opportunity to work on real scientific projects and promote career ways related to the natural sciences. The School is divided into two camps(S3 and S3++) that take place in July and August each year. Around 50 students work in small groups of three or four people supervised by a mentor who is usually a PhD student or a postdoctoral researcher.
