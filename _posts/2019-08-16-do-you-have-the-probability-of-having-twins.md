### Here is a step-by-step guide to find it out

## Info: Make sure to have your genotyped genome saved in a folder onto your computer.


The likelihood of conceiving twins is a complex trait. It is probably affected by multiple genetic and environmental factors, depending on the type of twins. The two types of twins are classified as monozygotic and dizygotic.

Monozygotic (MZ) twins, also called identical twins, occur when a single egg cell is fertilized by a single sperm cell. The resulting zygote splits into two very early in development, leading to the formation of two separate embryos. MZ twins occur in 3 to 4 per 1,000 births worldwide. Research suggests that most cases of MZ twinning are not caused by genetic factors. However, a few families with a larger-than-expected number of MZ twins have been reported, which indicates that genetics may play a role. It is possible that genes involved in sticking cells together (cell adhesion) may contribute to MZ twinning, although this hypothesis has not been confirmed. Most of the time, the cause of MZ twinning is unknown.

only the mother’s genetics matter,
A father’s genes can’t make a woman release two eggs.
However, only women ovulate. So, the mother’s genes control this and the fathers don’t.

The second of these may also have implications for why some women respond better than others to in vitro fertilization.
