#### ANALYZING YOUR DNA

# HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT KINDS OF DISEASES YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO HAVE, OR blablabla

I was shocked when I have red that there are [**more than 26 million**](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612880/more-than-26-million-people-have-taken-an-at-home-ancestry-test/) people who have already done professional genotyping test at a popular company, while I have never even heard about this methode to learn more about yourself.

**SO, WHAT IS ACTUALLY GENOTYPING IS?**
Genotyping is a process which identifies differences in the DNA sequence of a sample. Researchers and professional companies(e.g. [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/)) try to find the variations (e.g. SNPs, if you do not know what SNPs are just read our [Introudtion post](https://juliaht.github.io/myDNA//introduction)) in each invidual’s genome to learn more about genetics and to determine one’s charateristics, possible diseases and so. 

**These days..**
Nowadays, genotyping is getting more and more popularity due to the fact that people would like to learn more about themselves,their potential diseases and ancestry. You can find many emotional stories in the internet where people could find their unknown relatives through these companies, which can make us absolutely believe that these tests are totally succesful,precised and that we give our data to trustworthy firms.
