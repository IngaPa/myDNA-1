#### ANALYZING YOUR DNA

# HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT KINDS OF DISEASES YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO HAVE, OR WHAT 

I was shocked when I have red that there are [**more than 26 million**](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612880/more-than-26-million-people-have-taken-an-at-home-ancestry-test/) people who have already done professional genotyping test at a popular company, while I have never even heard about this methode to learn more about yourself.

**SO, WHAT IS ACTUALLY GENOTYPING IS?**
Genotyping is a process which identifies differences in the DNA sequence of a sample. Researchers and professional companies(e.g. [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/)) try to find the variations(e.g. SNPs, if you do not know what SNPs are just read our [Introudtion post](https://juliaht.github.io/myDNA//introduction)) in each invidual’s genome to learn more about genetics and to determine that one’s charateristics, possible diseases and so.
